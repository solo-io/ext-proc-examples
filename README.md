# External Processing examples

Example gRPC services that implement the interface used by Envoy's [External Processing filter](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/http/http_filters/ext_proc_filter)

Currently the examples in this repo are used to support Gloo Gateway [ExtProc documentation](https://docs.solo.io/gateway/latest/traffic-management/extproc/header-manipulation/) and Solo [blogs](https://www.solo.io/blog/extproc-info-leakage/).

These examples should only be considered sample code for Gloo Gateway enterprise users. They are not a supported component of any Gloo Gateway product. Do NOT use any of these examples in production systems.
